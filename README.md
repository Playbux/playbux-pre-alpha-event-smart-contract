# Playbux Pre-Alpha Event Smart Contracts

Playbux is a web3 platform that integrates various "earn while you play" features, aiming to redefine the way audiences engage with digital content. This platform is involved in different activities that integrate commerce, DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse activities.

1. **NFT Collections**: Playbux has launched NFT collections, such as the Ultra collection. This collection seems to include various benefits, animations, and utilities. Holders of these NFTs can participate in different features and gain access to the metaverse when the alpha version is live.

2. **Ultra Level Benefits**: Users of Playbux can enjoy different benefits based on their Ultra level. This includes daily check-ins for extra BRK (an in-game currency), free mystery box pieces weekly, increased cashback bonuses from the Shop to Earn feature, and bonus lotto ticket pieces for VIPs in the Watch to Earn program.

3. **Watch to Earn Feature**: In collaboration with iQIYI, a global streaming leader, Playbux offers a "Watch to Earn" feature. This allows users to earn digital prizes by watching content. Users need to watch content for a certain duration (30 minutes for free users and 15 minutes for VIP users) to claim daily rewards, including lotto tickets, BRK, box pieces, and exclusive NFTs.

4. **Lotto Pools**: Playbux introduces a lotto ticket mechanic, where users can participate in lotto pools or the Lucky Trees game for various rewards. These rewards include BUSD, BRK, NFTs, and more. The lotto tickets are obtained through events like Watch to Earn and cannot be purchased directly.

5. **Shop to Earn**: This feature allows users to make purchases from thousands of merchants worldwide and receive cashback in the form of credits. The cashback percentage is fixed at 2%, but Ultra users can get additional cashback bonuses.

6. **Upcoming Phases**: Playbux plans to introduce new phases and features, including a VIP feature offering exclusive benefits and a streamlined process to claim daily rewards and participate in lotto pools.
